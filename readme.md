## Tasks

Some tasks - choose as many or as few as you would like to complete.

1. Add some tests - a test suite such as mocha will require adding. The node backend functions require testing as well as front end functions.
2. The person table needs completeing - at the very least complete the edit function.
2. Convert the backend to use a non-volatile data store - a simple option would be to build in support for sqlite to save data to a database.
3. We need to add further elements - Landlords and Buildings. Buildings require Rooms.
4. Consider the UI - can it be improved - what would you suggest?

## Gotchas

1. Style matters.
2. eslint and typescript checking are enabled in this project for vscode - keep an eye on this.
3. Show us your git etiquette
